Unfortunately the freshly minted http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/[JSF 2.0] spec still doesn't support a
generic http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/collections/index.html[Collection] interface. Currently only
a http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/List.html[List] is supported and while this does work for many
situations, it does cause many issues when you are working with a full http://java.sun.com/javaee/[JavaEE] stack
since it may be necessary to use http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Set.html[Set] or
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html[SortedSet] when working with
http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp[JPA].

It hasn't been used in the past, but it's time for the users to start voting on java.net. So go there, register and
throw some of your votes towards this painful issue.
