Unfortunately the freshly minted "JSF 2.0":http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/ spec still doesn't support a generic "Collection":http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/collections/index.html interface. Currently only a "List":http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/List.html is supported and while this does work for many situations, it does cause many issues when you are working with a full "EE":http://java.sun.com/javaee/ stack since it may be necessary to use "Set":http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Set.html or "SortedSet":http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html when working with "JPA":http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp.

It hasn't been used in the past, but it's time for the users to start voting on java.net. So go there, register and throw some of your votes towards this painful issue..
